Every once in a while I start funny little side projects and occasionally they work out pretty well.

One of the most common questions on any in-city social media is “What’s happening tonight?” And while you can post posters, run a yellow page, run a yellow page in your discord, while you can lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink. 
You can bring roleplayers to an environment, but you can't make them read. 

This year I started a little Google calendar that is supposedly written as IC or as close to IC as I can. 
Each event shows what the event is, when it’s on, times details and all sorts of magic things. Google locations mean you can organise things nicely. 
You help the wider community and in-city businesses figure out if something overlaps or when the best time might be to put an event on. 

Google also has some cool perks: 

- Inviting people to your calendar, some people reached out and asked to be added to the calendar so it shows up on top of their own stuff. 

- If your extra nerdy and knee-deep in Google you can set it up so that when you ask Google it will tell you what events are on that day in city.

- Local times, while Production RP is based on EST time zone, I am not. Google automatically translates the times so I have a realistic idea of when an event on (Which is mostly 1 am sadge)  

- Being completely stand-alone, you can build a solo build of an event calendar meaning no one needs to hand over any info, open the calendar, look at it and dip.

- If your a real nerd, you can print it out and put it on your fridge. 

- Does this stop people from putting events on at the same time, absolutely not, exhibit A being 5 events. in the space of a few hours. It’s chaos but I wouldn't have it any other way.

While this is great for IC, it has a deeper value for OOC work, as a server developer, your main goal is to push fixes and plan maintenance to be at weird times not to bring the city down or at peak times, 
with a month or so of data you can work out and map peak times, plan when you can bring the server down in a more effective way.
