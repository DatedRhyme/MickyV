"Micky V here lads, I thought I'd come and sit and talk about some of the sidequests and projects I've made"
-------------------------------------------------------

Alot of the projects I write about here are dumb things I've put together while hanging around [ProductionRP](https://www.productionrp.org/)

Micky's Magic Calander, [I made this for a bit of a laugh, 3 months later, everyone in city swears by ](https://github.com/DatedRhyme/PRPSideQuests/blob/main/Event%20Calendar)

DJing live into Five,M [I've done that a few times, let me tell you what works, what doesn't, and some banging music](https://github.com/DatedRhyme/PRPSideQuests/blob/main/DJing%20in%20FiveM)


Big love to some great people:
Ghost is stinky
Kerm doesn't sleep
Boba has to deal with my dumb stuff, bless him
Niebs never picks up my calls, still waiting on those cigars

If I see strykz one of us is up past our bedtime
